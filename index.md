## Motivation
Like its predecessors, the 22nd Workshop on Automotive Software Engineering addresses the issue of software development in the automotive sector and, consequently, methods, techniques and tools suitable for it. With increasingly networked vehicles, modern driver assistance functions, and the challenges of fully automated driving, automotive software now plays a more critical role than ever. In addition to the ever-increasing complexity, ever-stricter requirements for reliability, security (safety and security) and data protection (privacy) must be met. Furthermore, the distraction-free and intuitive, multimodal operation of vehicle applications employing voice and gesture control is increasingly important. The trend towards networking has long since reached the vehicle. Driving is thus being changed by advancing "digital cultures": Value-added services (e.g. social media, streaming, office) will be integrated even more consistently in the vehicle and can then be operated by the users while driving. This workshop will discuss challenges and solution approaches of _Automotive Software Engineering_. Of particular interest is the use of agile methods in a regulated environment. Contributions from all areas of software development for modern vehicles are welcome.

## Goals

This workshop will discuss challenges and approaches to solutions in automotive software engineering. Contributions from all areas of software development for modern vehicles are welcome. The workshop is aimed equally at researchers, developers, and users from the automotive industry, as well as scientists from research institutes and universities working in automotive software engineering. The focus is traditionally less on theoretical and more on practical work.
